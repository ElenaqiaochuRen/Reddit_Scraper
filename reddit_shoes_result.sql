And I''m on my feet at work on hard tile floors in heat for hours at a time. Furthermore, I walk to work, which means I need something that won''t wear down easy, and is water proof/resistant. But also with a lot of comfort/cushion. That said, budget is supper tight after all the shit this year. I''m pretty behind. So I''m trying to keep it under 70/80 if possible. Any suggestions? I don''t mean to sound picky but my current shoes are on death''s door and my feet hurt constantly after and during work after only a few hours.','https://www.reddit.com/r/Shoes/comments/kac2my/having_a_hard_time_finding_a_good_work_shoe/','2020-12-19 21:50:24.178740','WaffleBot626','2020-12-10 08:57:20','<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x12272a390>');
